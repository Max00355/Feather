# About

Feather is an extremely light weight PHP web framework for writing PHP web app in environments with limited resources, or where minimal overhead is preferred. Simple include the `Feather.php` file to get started.

Feather is basically a set of helper functions that make routing and other common tasks in PHP simpler and more consistent. It is not meant to be a full fleged framework, but more as a solution to a specific problem. If you are looking for a more serious framework then there are plenty out there already
that do a better job than Feather does. If you just want to make a quick demo app and don't want to spend time installing big framework, then Feather is for you.
